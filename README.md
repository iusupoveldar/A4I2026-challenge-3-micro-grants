# Community Economic Resilience & Micro-Grants

A research prototype for deciding where small-business stabilization funding
could reduce connected harm to a commercial corridor. We separate **who is
exposed** through a modeled graph, **industry loan charge-off likelihood** from
SBA outcomes, and **what a grant could change** under explicit assumptions.

**Implemented:** a reproducible source audit, upstream/downstream traversal
through eight hops, BigQuery property-graph queries, SBA validation notebooks,
four cooperating agent modules, deterministic scoring, three funding regimes,
sensitivity checks, and structured audit reports.

**Exercised locally:** the 232-record registry review, 293-link supply model,
33 regression and integration tests, the deterministic four-agent benchmark, and the real-source
`EVIDENCE_ONLY` workflow. The benchmark runs all three funding regimes and passes
its ten scenario audit checks. Its financials and beneficiary totals are assumed;
these checks do not establish real grant effectiveness.

**Awaiting cloud validation:** the revised BigQuery SQL, canonical rate export
and new notebook diagnostics need an authenticated rerun. Live Google ADK/cloud
execution also needs verification. Earlier saved statistical results are
identified separately below.

Read the [reproducible review](data/TASK_2_3_REVIEW.md) and
[record-level audit](data/task_2_3_review.json) for current findings and source
corrections. Registry records are not necessarily distinct firms or physical
storefronts; possible duplicate filings remain visible for resolution.

## Task 2 — implemented graph work

| Capability | Implementation and evidence | Validation status |
|---|---|---|
| Three node types and three relationship types | `Business`, `Employer`, `Lender`; `Supplies`, `DrawsFootfall`, `BorrowedFrom` in [graph DDL and SQL](data/custom_bq_upload/schema_and_queries.sql) and the [connector](tools/bigquery_connector.py). One canonical graph: `a4i_econ.LocalEconomy`. | Revised cloud definitions implemented; execution pending. |
| Multi-hop impact and depth sensitivity | [Graph engine](tools/resilience_analysis.py) returns upstream/downstream reach for 1–8 hops, new/cumulative destinations, shortest explanation paths, and strongest weighted paths. GQL uses `ANY SHORTEST`; cycles and repeated paths cannot inflate unique reach. | Local traversal tested, including a six-hop chain; revised cloud GQL pending. |
| Keystone shortlist and hub comparison | Two-hop **5–25 destination** policy band, raw-reach baseline, weighted exposure, and GQL `NEXT ... FILTER` in [query B](data/custom_bq_upload/schema_and_queries.sql). Businesses outside the band remain eligible for a separate direct-relief/access review. | Local shortlist and hub-loss counterexample tested; cloud query pending. |
| Duplicate and branch audit | [Review builder](scripts/review_tasks_2_3.py) records IDs, legal names and addresses; [load notebook](notebooks/c3_01_load_explore.ipynb) stops on conflicting location keys. Same-name records are not silently merged or manually pinned. | Local review: nine same-name groups; four possible duplicate-filing groups remain unresolved. |
| Registry tenure and NAICS precision | Location start dates and coordinates come from the SF registry. Short/nonstandard NAICS values retain their precision and use sector fallback, rather than being guessed into groceries or restaurants. | Local source corrections checked; cloud loader updated. |
| Downstream debt and lender exposure | Address-checked loan edges and [query E](data/custom_bq_upload/schema_and_queries.sql) link exposed businesses to loan/lender evidence, retaining businesses without a match as **unknown debt**. | SQL implemented; revised cloud results pending. |
| Two-direction employer shock | [Query D](data/custom_bq_upload/schema_and_queries.sql) follows employer demand loss to storefronts and upstream suppliers. Footfall is aggregated before supplier joins to prevent multiplication. | SQL implemented; employer/footfall sources are not available locally. |

Two hops is the decision baseline; depths 3–8 test additional exposure. In the
current local model, seven roots gain new destinations at hop 3 and none at
hops 4–8. For Cumaica Coffee, cumulative reach is **27 → 51 → 55** at hops 1–3,
then stays at 55. This is a model-specific finding, not a universal impact limit.

## Task 3 — implemented analysis work

| Capability | Implementation and evidence | Validation status |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical failure priors and industry job proxies | [Validation notebook](notebooks/Challenge3.ipynb), section 8: horizon-controlled SBA outcomes, hierarchical beta-binomial shrinkage, uncertainty intervals, and computed loan-cohort median jobs. Exact-detail → sector → state fallback. Only `industry_failure_rates` is accepted. | Historical validation exists; the revised full export is pending and is not present locally. Industry jobs are not measured storefront employment. |
| Buyer-specific input alternatives | [Graph engine](tools/resilience_analysis.py) and enriched SQL count other same-input modeled suppliers connected to each buyer within 500m. A corridor-wide peer count is kept separate from buyer substitution. | Local counterexamples tested; these remain modeled options, not verified vendor substitutability. |
| Distance-decay sensitivity | Edge weights use `intensity × exp(-metres / 400) / (1 + buyer_input_alternatives)`. Path weights multiply; each endpoint contributes its strongest exposure once. Before/after ranks include all industries. | Local ranks generated; no named winner is forced. Revised cloud comparison pending. |
| Charge-off confusion matrix | Notebook section 10b evaluates a fixed 3% threshold on the SF holdout using rates fitted outside SF. | Implemented; new diagnostic has no saved result until rerun. |
| Industry variety and equity audit | Local cohort/shortlist counts, shares and concentration; notebook coverage and poverty/zero-vehicle comparisons using a labeled nearest-workplace-tract proxy. | Industry audit checked locally; revised ACS/footfall equity results pending. |
| Sole-proprietor selection-bias report | The saved SBA run reports **18,698 excluded individual/sole-proprietor loans**. Source rules keep missing SBA history separate from zero need. | Historical exclusion count documented; no claim that this validates unbanked or excluded businesses. |

The current source has **nine named industry groups plus one unspecified `72`
record**. The 20-record cascade shortlist covers only three groups: food services
are **70.0% of the shortlist versus 21.6% of the cohort**. This identifies the
supply model's sector bias; it does not justify a complete grant portfolio.
Retail, health care and other access-oriented cases need their own review.

## Other implemented modules

These capabilities already exist in the repository in addition to Tasks 2 and 3:

| Module | What is implemented | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Four-agent coordination and selection | [Orchestrator](agents/regime_orchestrator_agent.py) coordinates [supply/provenance](agents/supply_provenance_agent.py), [runway/sector/purity](agents/runway_sector_purity_agent.py), and [spatial/human impact](agents/spatial_human_impact_agent.py). Named selectors, standalone agent packages, Google ADK factories and a [root entrypoint](agent/agent.py) are wired in code. | All four deterministic selectors and their source gates tested; live model-backed execution not verified in this review. |
| Five scoring dimensions | [Scoring engine](tools/scoring_engine.py): financial runway and marginal survival lift; sector volatility; people-helped/efficiency scores combining direct workers, network workers, commuters and residents; small-business ownership/size purity; upstream/root-supplier importance. Community-anchor and ACS equity multipliers are also implemented. | Scenario calculations; current applicant finances and service reach are not inferred from registry data. |
| Eligibility and provenance rules | Supplied ownership, headcount, location and storefront inputs; NAICS-81 scenario filters; modeled/verified tags; invoice-request flags; zero-cascade comparison. | Policy/model assumptions. A verification flag is not an inspected invoice or a statutory eligibility determination. |
| Funding regime comparison | Full-grant threshold (A), concave bridge (B), and tiered hybrid (C), with budget limits, indivisible-shock handling and alternate-routing fields. Regime C reserves a community-anchor slot and attempts cluster top-ups. | Priority-based scenario allocation. Despite the `optimize_portfolio_knapsack` name, this is not an exact knapsack solver or a guarantee that every cluster can reach critical mass. |
| Overlap, spatial and bottleneck diagnostics | Jaccard downstream overlap penalties, proximity/critical-mass checks, and unapplied-supplier alert dossiers. | Overlap is reported after allocation; cluster selection uses a heuristic with a final spatial audit. Legacy bottleneck alerts use fixture/industry assumptions, not source-verified supplier discovery. |
| Sensitivity analysis | Four policy-weight configurations plus a 51-point cascade/anchor sweep; reports intersections and sampled ranking intervals. | Sampled scenario checks, not a proof across all weights. The returned `0.72` crossover narrative is fixture metadata. |
| Audit reports and context tools | [Reporter](tools/compliance_reporter.py) evaluates ten scenario attack vectors and a five-step field checklist, then generates a Markdown determination-style report. [Context loader](ADK/adk_context_loader.py) indexes seven documents, equations, agent rubrics and defense sections, including the merged refactor guide. | Benchmark report generation exercised; no independent audit certificate or actual award approval. |
| Source-evidence safeguards | Real-source agent records return `EVIDENCE_ONLY`; missing finances, ownership and invoices are not fabricated. The source loader never silently falls back to the illustrative benchmark. | Source-mode behavior and refusal to score incomplete source records tested. |
| Live traversal, comparison and MCP wiring | [Connector](tools/bigquery_connector.py) exposes named shortest paths, graph traversal, applicant comparison and funding entrypoints; [MCP toolsets](tools/mcp_bigquery_toolset.py) and [toolbox definitions](tools.yaml) wire Google-managed BigQuery access. | Integration tests cover live-query failure, eight-hop/timeout propagation and evidence gates. A failed cloud call returns no invented paths; explicit local mode identifies BFS results separately. Authenticated MCP/GQL calls remain unverified. |
| Runtime and deployment sources | [Server](server/app.py), [runtime deployment](scripts/deploy_agent_runtime.py), [deployment script](scripts/deploy.sh) and [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) provide the merged service/deployment entrypoints. See the [refactor and verification guide](ADK/docs/04_ADK_REFACTOR_AND_TEST_GUIDE.md). | Source code present; no deployment or live service verification performed in this review. |

The [source-evidence rules](ADK/docs/04_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_AND_REVIEW.md) take priority
over numerical examples and policy assumptions in the earlier design documents.

## Five linked community problems

| Problem | Connected mechanism | Current evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Input disruption | Supplier loss → buyers → further buyers | Traversable in the local modeled supply graph. |
| Lost upstream orders | Storefront demand loss → its suppliers | Traversable in reverse; order losses are not measured. |
| Lost worker demand | Employer block → storefronts → upstream suppliers | Cloud source/query support implemented; no local footfall snapshot. |
| Debt pressure | Exposed business → matched loan → lender | Strict-match SQL implemented; historical borrowing does not establish current distress. |
| Essential-service access | Affected food/health/community services → residents | Industry exposure proxy; catchment and resident-reach evidence still needed. |

Graph depth and the number of social mechanisms are different. A four-hop path
does not by itself establish four independently measured community harms.

## Reproduce locally

No third-party Python dependency or cloud credential is needed for the source review:

```sh
python3 scripts/review_tasks_2_3.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 run_adk_test.py --mode local_csv
```

Run the assumed-input benchmark separately to exercise all four agent modules,
the three funding regimes, sensitivity analysis and audit-report generation:

```sh
python3 run_adk_test.py --mode canonical
python3 run_adk_test.py --list-agents
python3 run_adk_test.py --agent Supply_Provenance_Agent --mode local_csv
```

The local tests cover long-chain/reverse traversal, cycles, convergent paths,
strongest-versus-shortest paths, buyer alternatives, decay, invalid graph inputs,
the keystone band, NAICS precision, prior fallback, missing financial evidence,
all four agent selectors, connector timeouts, business-ID/name lookup, ambiguous
branches, scenario-ID separation and failure handling.
With `requirements.txt` installed, startup checks also load the real ADK
entrypoint and run a mock-model chat through the actual ADK runner. These checks
catch import and tool-registration failures; they do not validate cloud credentials
or replace a smoke test against the deployed Gemini/BigQuery environment.

The generated Markdown review and JSON audit include source coordinates, both
traversal directions, depth through eight hops, industry concentration and missing
evidence. Agent tools return the paths explaining each business's exposure.

The local reviewed supply model uses the pinned BEA coefficients, a **0.015**
coefficient floor, **500m** maximum distance, **five** suppliers per buyer and
**400m** exponential decay. These are declared modeling choices. The report also
rebuilds the starter's **0.005 / 1200m** variant for sensitivity; the two graphs'
counts must never be combined. Neither contains observed vendor contracts.

Registry snapshot: [public source](https://data.sf.gov/resource/g8m3-pdis.json),
as of 2026-10-20. [Activity groups](https://sftreasurer.org/business-activities-naics-codes)
follow the SF Treasurer's page. Source hashes and every changed NAICS/year value
are in the audit. The inherited cohort is not a fresh citywide sample.

## Reproduce in the authenticated BigQuery environment

1. Run [the load notebook](notebooks/c3_01_load_explore.ipynb) from this checkout.
   Review duplicate IDs and both addresses before resolving any collision.
   It now retains `location_start_date` and distinct same-name locations.
2. Run [the validation notebook](notebooks/Challenge3.ipynb). It publishes the
   canonical `industry_failure_rates`, exports its CSV, applies strict address
   checks, and adds depth, weighted exposure, industry variety, a held-out
   confusion matrix and an equity audit with a labeled workplace-tract proxy.
   Revised cells have no saved output until rerun. Earlier saved model validation
   outputs are historical evidence, not a fresh execution of the revised pipeline.
3. Run [the reviewed SQL](data/custom_bq_upload/schema_and_queries.sql) after
   those source tables exist. It preserves base tables and creates reviewed
   tables plus **one canonical graph, `a4i_econ.LocalEconomy`**. Duplicate keys,
   rate horizons and source metadata are checked before traversal. No loan or
   prior is synthesized through an `UNNEST` list.
4. Copy the notebook's full `data/industry_failure_rates.csv` into this checkout
   and run `python3 scripts/review_tasks_2_3.py --rates data/industry_failure_rates.csv`.
   Never reconstruct the full table from the few displayed notebook rows.

No cloud migration or paid reservation was executed during this local review.
The public cloud snapshot requires credentials unavailable in this environment.
The SQL and revised cloud notebook cells require execution in the authenticated
project before their new results can be cited.

## What remains before a real deployment or grant decision

- Execute the revised SQL/notebook cells in the authenticated project and retain
  their outputs, including the full canonical rate export, confusion matrix,
  equity coverage and actual GQL/table-traversal agreement.
- Resolve the four possible duplicate-filing groups against source records;
  the review deliberately reports registry IDs rather than confirmed unique firms.
- Supply current applicant cash, operating burn, debt payments, ownership,
  eligibility and vendor evidence. The $8,000 debt-bridge function is implemented,
  but its causal effectiveness is assumed and missing debt stays unknown.
- Validate live Google ADK/Vertex AI execution, a consumed Google-managed MCP
  integration, and cloud deployment. Their operational completion is not verified
  by this checkout or the deterministic benchmark.

## Evidence for failure likelihood

The [validation notebook](notebooks/Challenge3.ipynb) implements loan-term,
approval-year, age and franchise controls; training outside SF with an SF
holdout; cross-fitted industry priors; statewide five-fold cross-validation;
paired bootstrap AUC intervals; industry-clustered odds ratios; calibration
checks; and 24/36/48/60-month horizon sensitivity. These methods are part of the
implemented validation work, alongside the new diagnostics listed under Task 3.

The saved notebook analyzed 58,647 eligible California SBA 7(a) loans with a
48-month horizon (1,570 charge-offs), holding out 1,490 SF loans with 34 failures.
Loan terms alone had AUC **0.700**; adding graph structure gave **0.695**, change
**−0.005** with interval **−0.018 to +0.007**. No predictive gain is established.
The underlying SBA population excluded 18,698 individual/sole-proprietor loans;
its results cannot establish outcomes for excluded or unbanked businesses.
Industry history also had an interval spanning zero for its incremental AUC.
Across 47 industries, hub reach versus charge-off risk gave **rho −0.14, p=0.33**:
no positive association is established. This does not prove the true effect is zero.

Use graph structure for modeled consequence and SBA history as an industry
charge-off prior. Charge-off is not a storefront closure. SBA industry median
jobs are loan-cohort proxies, not measured employment at each business. Historical
charge-off does not demonstrate current insolvency. Current cash, burn, debt,
ownership, invoices and service catchments need applicant evidence.

## Agent behavior

`analyze_corridor_impact(business_id, max_hops=1..8, direction='downstream'|'upstream')`
returns evidence paths, unique reach and industry exposure. `review_industry_variety()`
compares the cohort and cascade shortlist. Source-based records return
`EVIDENCE_ONLY` from the orchestrator until financial/eligibility evidence exists.
The named 11-applicant benchmark remains available explicitly as an illustrative
scenario; it is never a silent fallback for real data.

Call `find_corridor_businesses("Sour Flour")` before tracing: the registry ID is
`1088753-08-161`; the illustrative `cm_01` is a separate scenario ID. A unique
exact business/legal name is also accepted. Unknown, ambiguous, partial and
scenario identifiers return structured statuses and candidate locations; only
`status == "OK"` contains a completed traversal. Same-name branches require
selecting a registry ID using its address.
